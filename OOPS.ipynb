        "1.What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        " =Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming style that organizes code into **objects**, which are instances of **classes**. It uses key concepts like **encapsulation**, **inheritance**, **polymorphism**, and **abstraction** to make code more modular, reusable, and easier to maintain.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.What is a class in OOP.\n",
        " =A class in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines the properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) that the objects created from the class will have.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.What is an object in OOP.\n",
        " = An object in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is an instance of a class. It represents a real-world entity with its own data (attributes) and behavior (methods) defined by the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation.\n",
        " =Abstraction hides complex details and shows only the essential features to the user.\n",
        " Encapsulation hides the internal state of an object and controls access to it using methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "5.What are dunder methods in Python.\n",
        " = Dunder methods (double underscore methods) are special methods in Python like __init__, __str__, or __add__ that let you define how objects behave with built-in functions and operators.\n",
        " Example: __str__ controls how an object is printed.\n",
        "\n",
        "6.Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP.\n",
        " =Inheritance in OOP allows a child class to use the attributes and methods of a parent class, promoting code reuse and extensibility.\n",
        "\n",
        "7.What is polymorphism in OOP.\n",
        " =Polymorphism in OOP means “many forms” — it allows objects of different classes to be treated through the same interface, typically by having methods with the same name but different behaviors.\n",
        "\n",
        "8.How is encapsulation achieved in Python.\n",
        " =Encapsulation in Python is a way to restrict access to the internal details (data and methods) of a class and only expose a controlled interface to the outside world. This helps in protecting the object’s state from unintended or harmful modifications and keeps the implementation hidden.\n",
        "\n",
        "9.What is a constructor in Python.\n",
        " =A constructor in Python is a special method called __init__ that is automatically called when a new object of a class is created. It is used to initialize the object's attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "10.What are class and static methods in Python.\n",
        " =Class methods are methods that receive the class itself as the first argument (cls) instead of an instance. They are defined using the @classmethod decorator and can access or modify class state.\n",
        "\n",
        " Static methods don’t receive an implicit first argument (neither self nor cls). They are defined with the @staticmethod decorator and behave like regular functions but belong to the class’s namespace.\n",
        "\n",
        "11.What is method overloading in Python.\n",
        " =Method overloading in Python refers to the ability to define multiple methods with the same name but different parameters.\n",
        "\n",
        "12.What is method overriding in OOP.\n",
        " =Method overriding in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is when a subclass provides its own version of a method that is already defined in its parent class. The subclass’s method replaces the parent class’s method when called on an instance of the subclass.\n",
        "\n",
        " This allows a subclass to customize or extend the behavior of the parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "13.What is a property decorator in Python.\n",
        " = The @property decorator in Python is used to define a method as a getter for a class attribute, allowing you to access it like a regular attribute instead of calling a method. It helps in controlling access to private attributes while keeping a clean and simple syntax.\n",
        "\n",
        "14.Why is polymorphism important in OOP.\n",
        " =Polymorphism is important in OOP because it allows objects of different classes to be treated through a common interface, enabling flexible and reusable code. It lets you write code that works with objects of multiple types, as long as they share certain behaviors (methods), without worrying about their specific class.\n",
        "\n",
        "15.What is an abstract class in Python.\n",
        " = An abstract class in Python is a class that cannot be instantiated directly and is meant to be a blueprint for other classes. It can define abstract methods that must be implemented by any subclass.\n",
        "\n",
        "16.What are the advantages of OOP.  \n",
        "=Modularity: Organizes code into reusable objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "Encapsulation: Protects data by hiding internal details.\n",
        "\n",
        "Inheritance: Reuses and extends existing code.\n",
        "\n",
        "Polymorphism: Allows different objects to be used interchangeably.\n",
        "\n",
        "Maintainability: Easier to update and manage code.\n",
        "\n",
        "17.What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable.\n",
        " =lass variable: Shared by all instances of a class. Defined directly inside the class.\n",
        "\n",
        " Instance variable: Unique to each instance/object. Defined inside methods like __init__ using self.\n",
        "\n",
        "18.What is multiple inheritance in Python.\n",
        " = Multiple inheritance in Python is when a class inherits from more than one parent class, gaining the properties and methods of all those parent classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "19.Explain the purpose of ‘’__str__’ and ‘__repr__’ ‘ methods in Python.\n",
        " =The __str__ and __repr__ methods in Python are used to provide string representations of objects, but they serve different purposes.\n",
        "\n",
        "20.What is the significance of the ‘super()’ function in Python.\n",
        " =The super() function in Python is used to call a method from a parent (super) class inside a subclass.\n",
        "\n",
        "21.What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python.\n",
        " =The __del__ method in Python is a destructor that is called when an object is about to be destroyed (i.e., when its reference count drops to zero). It allows you to clean up resources like closing files or network connections before the object is removed from memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "22.What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python.\n",
        " = @staticmethod: A method that doesn’t take self or cls; acts like a regular function inside the class.\n",
        "\n",
        " @classmethod: A method that takes cls as the first argument and can access or modify class-level data.\n",
        "\n",
        "23.How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance.\n",
        " =Polymorphism with inheritance in Python means a subclass can override methods of its parent class, and when you call that method on an instance, Python uses the subclass’s version.\n",
        "\n",
        "24.What is method chaining in Python OOP.\n",
        " =Method chaining in Python OOP is a technique where multiple methods are called in a single statement, one after another, because each method returns the object itself (self). This allows for a clean, fluent interface.\n",
        "\n",
        "25.What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python.\n",
        " =The __call__ method in Python allows an instance of a class to be called like a function. When you use parentheses on an object (obj()), Python invokes its __call__ method.\n"
